## Project Summary
Our project seeks to showcase the ease of ingesting big data into AWS S3, creating materialized views and exploring data quickly using AWS RedShift, visualizing meaningful dashboards to drive business insights through AWS QuickSight, and automatically sharing reports with teammates via AWS Lambda. Combined, our project shows a full data analytics pipeline capable of managing very large amounts of data with exceptional performance at a fraction of the cost of alternative tools. Our project would be suitable for any oraganization that needs to analyze and visualize large amounts of structured and unstructured data quickly.
  
This project uses the Iowa Liquor Sales 2020 dataset available on Kaggle through [this link](https://kaggle.com/datasets/sibmike/iowaliquorsales2020). This dataset includes transactions for multiple locations and dates throughout Iowa and includes both structured data, such as price per unit sold, and unstructured data, such as free text product descriptions. The goal of the project is not to explore this particular dataset for actionable insights, but to show the process of ingesting, manipulating, visualizing, and sharing data for such a large and complex file. Our pipeline could be adapted easily to other forms of transactional data, or the principles could be aplied to another large data source or project.
